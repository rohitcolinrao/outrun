# Databases
* Relational Databases (RDBMS) (Relational Database Management System)
  * Designed based on "normalization" of data
  * Various normalized forms:
    * First normalized form (1NF)
    * Second normalized form (2NF)
    * Third normalized form (3NF)
  * In order to retrieve data, you need to use a language called SQL (pronounce sequel)
  * SQL syntax is relatively simple but as we get further into things like "joins" (joining data across tables), it gets more complex
  * Examples: Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL
* NoSQL Databases (non normalized data)
  * These are databases that are designed like documents.  If you were to think of a javascript object as a paper document, these databases would be like a virtual version of an old file cabinet with a bunch of javascript objects in them (documents)
  * MongoDB (one of the most popular NoSQL databases)
  * Amazon has one called DynamoDB
  * Google has one called Cloud Firestore
* Postgres is my preferred database for enterprise level applications
  * What makes PostgreSQL a good database is that it is a relational database that has the ability to store JSON objects in a field type called jsonb

# Designing for relational databases
  * Ecommerce application - think about all the different types of data that you would need to store
    * Tables have columns of data in them
    * Every table needs to have what's called a Primary Key (PK)
      * A primary key is a UNIQUE FIELD to identify each row of data
      * Generally just use a unique integer column as the PK
    * Columns are based on type of data (strings, integers, jsonb (only in postgres))
      * Users

# Homework
* Download PostgreSQL
* Set up an account on AWS
* Start reviewing and learning the basic SELECT commands on how to query data with SQL
  * https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-char-varchar-text/
  * select * from users;
  * select * from users WHERE email='email1@gmail.com' OR email='email2@gmail.com'
  * select * from users, creditcards where users.email='email1@gmail.com' and users."creditcardId" = creditcards.id;
